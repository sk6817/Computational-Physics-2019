There are separate .py files for each section (e.g. Random Numbers.py, Interpolation.py).
For all of the .py files, you can run each cell (on Spyder), specific to each subquestion (Press shift + enter) 
to reproduce the results. 

Some of the verification methods were commented out to make the results clearer. 
You can uncomment them to see if they work.

In each subsection, I stated in docstring what we want to do in the beginning to make it clearer.
For each function defined, I stated the input, output and the procedure. 

The language used was Python 3. As for hardware, I used Google Colaboratory (most of the time) and Spyder on an Imperial Computer. 
Google Colab is essentially a Jupyter Notebook running on google server, and all changes are saved on the drive. 
They all work well in Spyder however the machine epsilon result may vary. The specs details can be found online.
