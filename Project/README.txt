Topic: A log-likelihood fit for extracting neutrino oscillation parameters

The data is saved on a csv file, named 'data.csv', in the same folder as the codes.
There are separate .py files for each section coherent to the report. These are:-
1) The data
2) 1D Minimisation
3) 2D Minimisation
4) 3D Minimisation

For all of the .py files, you can run each cell (on Spyder, Press Shift + Enter) 
to reproduce the results in each appropriate subsection. 

Few of the verification methods (e.g. scipy optimize) were commented out to make the results clearer. 
You can uncomment them to see if they work. 

The language used was Python 3. As for hardware, I used Spyder on an Imperial Computer (mostly).
